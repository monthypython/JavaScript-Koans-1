#Summary
JavaScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of JavaScript in a logical sequence. 

The inspiration for this project comes from the Edgecase Ruby Koans and the book 'Javascript: The Good Parts'.

#JavaScript Fundamentals

This is a simplified version of the original JavaScript Koans, containing only the numbers, arrays, and objects koans.

#Instructions
Open the file jskoans.htm in your favourite browser and make the tests pass.

#Resources
The koans use the [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/) test syntax and test runner.
